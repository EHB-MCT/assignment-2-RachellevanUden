# Assignment 2: Rachelle van Uden

## Project Description
This project involves gathering and visualizing data collected from Lost Ark's DPS (Damage Per Second) Meter. The goal is to provide insights into player performance, skill usage, and efficiency based on user data. This will help players analyze their gameplay and improve their performance.

## Project Structure
- **`src/`** - Application code (components, services)
  - **`backend/`** - Backend logic, including API endpoints and database interactions.
  - **`frontend/`** - React-based frontend for displaying visualizations.
- **`public/`** - Static files such as images, icons, and the HTML entry point (`index.html`).
- **`docs/`** - Documentation including progress reports, technical decisions, and design notes.
- **`config/`** - Configuration files such as ESLint, Vite, etc.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

**Clone the repository**:
git clone https://github.com/je-naam/assignment-2-RachellevanUden.git

**Navigate to the project directoryy**:
cd assignment-2-RachellevanUden

**Install dependencies for both frontend and backend**:
    Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
    - Frontend (React + Vite):
    cd src/frontend
    npm install
    - Backend (Express + Nodemon):
    cd ../../src/backend
    npm install

**Start the project (runs both frontend and backend simultaneously)**:
    cd ../..
    npm run dev

    This will run the frontend on http://localhost:5174 and the backend on http://localhost:3000.

## Available Scripts
npm run dev: Start both the frontend and backend simultaneously.
npm run dev:frontend: Start the frontend (Vite).
npm run dev:backend: Start the backend (with Nodemon).

## Project Dependencies
Frontend:
React, React-DOM
Vite (for bundling and development)
ESLint (for linting)
Backend:
Express (for the API)
Nodemon (for live reloading during development)

## Folder Structure
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main folders:

src/: Contains all the source code, split into frontend and backend.
public/: Contains static files served directly to the user.
docs/: Contains documentation related to the project.
tests/: Contains unit tests and other test files.

## Gitignore
The project uses a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control, such as node_modules, build directories, and IDE settings.

Here is an overview of the ignored files:

node_modules/: Automatically generated by npm, contains installed dependencies.
dist/: Build files generated during the development process.
IDE-specific files: .vscode/, .idea/, etc.
